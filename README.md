# TransferLearning on Structured Dataset 
The following contains the code for standard classification, boosting and trasnfer loearning on target dataset. Dataset is imbalanced. 
We tried trasnfer learning with freezing the first k layers and retraining the last (n-k) layers: Retraining multiple layers, and unfreezing them. 

Transfer learning or inductive transfer is a research problem in machine learning that focuses on storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.

It is implemented using Tensorflow.

This folder contains codes to implement:

1.Traditional machein learning classification
2.Boosting classification 
3.Pretrained model based on Wisconswin Breast cancer datasets
4.Trasnfer learning model over pretrained model


All of these classifications are implemented on Mammographic mass dataset with small number of features.
